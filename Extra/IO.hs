-- |Use this module to call functions in the CIO module from the

-- information.  The verbosity controlled output functions will ignore
-- any calls when v is greater than zero.  This allows you to call the
-- functions in the haskell-debian package from the regular IO monad.
-- 
-- This is in a separate module from CIO so you don't accidentally do
-- a liftIO of some other CIO operation and get this instance.
